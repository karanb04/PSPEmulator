NOTE: Do not ask me about ROMS, I don't have them 
and I do not care that you can't find any for download!

psp-fceultra Release 1!
=====================

psp-fceultra  is a port of the NES/Famicom emulator fceultra to 
the psp.

Features:
 - Support for loads of nes roms (Best compatability of any nes emu on the psp??)
 - zip support
 - Correct ratio'd graphics, hardware accelerated renderer
 - 60fps on most games
 - built in game select screen

Missing 
 - Sound
 - More complete GUI
 - Save states
 - Cheat codes
 - mappable controls
 - Zapper support
 - FDS support
 - Optimisations

Installation:
For 1.5 firmware:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Copy the contents of the 1.5 folder to your psps memory stick. 
This should give you a /PSP/GAME/fceultra folder and a /PSP/GAME/fceultra% folder 
on your memory stick.
Copy your nes roms to your memory stick. 
psp-fceultra has a file browser so you can copy the roms anywhere. 
Personally I prefer to put them in the /GAME/PSP/fceultra/roms/ folder. 
Your roms can either be in .gb/.gbc/.rom/.zip format. .zip is 
recommended as it takes less space

Controls:
=========

Filebrowser:
-=-=-=-=-=-=
Currently the file broweser is quite basic. Use the d-pad to move up and down, and the X button to select a file or folder.
Selecting ".." will make the filebrowser go back to the parent folder.

In-game:
-=-=-=-=

D-pad: Nes d-pad
X button: nes'A' button
O button: nes 'B' button
select: nes select button
start: nes start button
Left Shoulder button: In-game gui. 
Currently exit rom option only but this will change in the next version.
